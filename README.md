# 🏋️‍♂️ KP GYM - The "Free Membership" Gym App

**Plot twist:** I literally coded this entire gym management app just to get 6 months of free gym membership 😂💪

*Was it worth it? Ask me in 6 months when I'm ripped!*

## 🎯 What This App Actually Does

- **Member Management**: Add members, track their subscriptions, and pretend to be organized
- **Income Tracking**: So the gym owner knows exactly how much money they're making (spoiler: it's a lot)
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Send automated "your membership is expiring" messages in Marathi because we're cultured like that
- **Notifications**: Because who doesn't want more notifications in their life?
- **Morning/Night Shift**: Because apparently gyms have shifts now 🌅🌙

## 🚀 The Tech Stack (AKA What I Learned While Procrastinating)

- **Flutter** - Because I wanted to build for both Android and iOS without learning Swift
- **SQLite** - Local database because cloud storage costs money
- **Provider** - State management (still don't fully understand it but it works)
- **Material Design** - Google's design system so I don't have to be creative
- **WhatsApp Integration** - The most important feature according to every Indian business owner

## 📱 Features That Actually Work

✅ Add/Edit/Delete members (basic CRUD, nothing fancy)  
✅ Track subscription expiry dates  
✅ Send WhatsApp reminders in Marathi  
✅ Income reports (gym owners love this)  
✅ Member search (Ctrl+F but for people)  
✅ Dark mode? Nah, who needs that  

## 💡 The Origin Story

**Me**: "I need a gym membership but I'm broke"  
**Gym Owner**: "Can you make an app for my gym?"  
**Me**: "Say no more fam" *cracks knuckles*  

6 months of coding later... here we are!

```bash

## 🎁 The Deal

**If you're a gym owner and want this app customized:**

1. I'll customize it for your gym
2. You give me 6 months of free membership
3. We both win (you get an app, I get gains)
4. Simple as that!

**Contact me**: Just create an issue on GitHub or find me at KP GYM (I'll be there for the next 6 months)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Sometimes the app crashes (it's not a bug, it's a feature)
- The UI could be prettier (but functional > beautiful, right?)
- No backup feature (pray your phone doesn't break)
- WhatsApp integration might annoy people (sorry not sorry)

**P.S.** If this app helps you manage your gym, great! If it doesn't, well... I still got my free membership 😎
